# Project Rules & Context

## 1. Core Philosophy: Portable First
This project is designed to run from a **USB Flash Drive**. 
- **Constraint**: IO speeds on USB are slow. Random read/write is expensive.
- **Constraint**: The user might move this folder to any computer (School, Office, Home).
- **Goal**: "Plug & Play". No complex installation on the host machine.

## 2. Technical Constraints
### Deployment
- **ALWAYS** use `output: 'standalone'` for Next.js builds.
- **NEVER** suggest copying the full `node_modules` folder for deployment. It contains too many small files.
- Prefers single-file executables or minimal file counts where possible.

### Runtime
- The system should run via the provided `start.bat` or `start.sh`.
- Do not rely on global npm packages (like `pm2` or `vercel`) unless they are bundled locally.

## 3. Database
- SQLite is used because it is serverless and file-based.
- Ensure the DB file (`data/babi.db`) is stored *outside* the `.next` build folder so it survives updates.

## 4. User Experience
- The app must handle "Cold Starts" gracefully.
- Offline support is crucial (no guaranteed internet on host machines).
